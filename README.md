In the UPC datahon, MANGO presented a challenge involving the creation of new outfits. Our team successfully tackled this challenge by devising a solution that constructs outfits iteratively based on the probability that two products complement each other. UPC Datahon Solution.

While the initial solution showed promise, it encountered robustation problems. In response, this project seeks to enhance the solution using variational autoencoders. As detailed in the accompanying report, our improved approach aims to deliver a viable solution for both customers and businesses. Key considerations include the speed of predictions and the ability to generate outfits in various sizes.
